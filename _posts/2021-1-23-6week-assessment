I'm halfway through my Outreachy internship with Zulip. My general task for the 12 weeks was
to  help improve the Zulip server and web application. Our plan for doing so was to continue
the same workflow that had developed during the application process with my mentor where we
identified current and relevant issues that built on my previous contributions.

Here are some of the things I've done so far ...

- API updates
  - Here's a fun example of my workflow with Zulip ...
    - There's a chat in the api_design stream where a question or idea arises.
    - My mentor asks if I can look into implementing that and I do.
    - Which then leads me to a follow-up task.
    - And another and so on.
  - I find this really rewarding because I get to help with current issues and
    gain some knowledge 

- Documentation updates
  - User documentation, such as the help center or REST API docs, is part of every Zulip server
  - I've helped update the API documentation so that endpoint parameters have more detailed descriptions
    of object parameters.

- Prototyped front end implementation of recent draft synchronization API
  - This was a task that my mentor suggested before I even started the internship. I knew
    would be a big learning curve for me.
  - Currently, Zulip supports drafts for messages in the local environment. But a draft that I start
    writing in Chrome, won't be synced to another browser (e.g. Firefox or Safari) on the same device
    or Chrome on another computer or device. The draft exists only in that local client instance. 
  - This past summer, Zulip added a back end implementation for syncing drafts via the server,
    but the front end hadn't yet been started.
  - I worked bit by bit, reading through the API and learning how the current local draft implementation
    works in the front end of the web application. It was quite rewarding when a draft I wrote in
    Firefox was then live updated on Chrome.

Here's some prompts that could get you started writing this blog post:

 - What was your original internship project timeline?
 - What goals have you met?
 - What have you accomplished in the first half of your internship?
 - What project goals took longer than expected?
 - Why did those project goals take longer than expected?
 - What would you do differently if you were starting the project over?
 - Which original goals needed to be modified?
 - What is your new plan for the second half of the internship?
