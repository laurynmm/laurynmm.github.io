Joining a project as a newcomer always requires a period of learning the existing systems of that community. You're introduced to the folks you'll be working with, the workflows and routines used in the day to day, the internal lingo used to refer to the different aspects of the project, and more.

One common hurdle of starting to contribute to many Open Source sofware projects is navigating the existing codebase, which can be overwhelming to the new contributor when looking at the recently cloned git repository on their local machine. I know that's how I felt when I decided to contribute to [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) during my Outreachy application process.

An oft repeated refrain in messages to new contributors from experienced Zulip folks is to use `git grep`. It was a new command line tool for me and learning to use it has been a huge help in gaining confidence and becoming more knowledgable about the project.
