Joining a project as a newcomer always requires learning the existing systems of that community. You're introduced to the folks you'll be working with, the workflows and routines used in the day-to-day, the internal lingo used to refer to the different aspects of the project, and more.

One common hurdle of starting to contribute to many Open Source Sofware projects is navigating the existing codebase, which can be overwhelming for a new contributor. When I first looked at the cloned [Zulip git repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) on my local machine, I know that's how I felt.

An oft repeated refrain in messages to new contributors from experienced Zulip folks is to use `git grep`. Prior to Zulip, I hadn't heard of this git command line tool and learning to use it has been a huge help in gaining confidence contributing and becoming more knowledgable about the project. 

Here's my intro to using `git grep` to navigate a large and complex repository like Zulip's.

## Trying it out

I'll admit my first few attempts at using `git grep` were not successful. Just like googling, knowing what you're looking for is important. Most of the time, using it on a word (e.g. browser) or very general idea (e.g. stream_id) isn't going to be very helpful.

But with something more concrete to look for like a variable (e.g. `max_message_length`), function (e.g. `do_update_message`) or setting (e.g. `mandatory_topics`) from the project, you'll get a good idea of where to start reading and potentially working.

So, before you start using `git grep`, it's worth the time to do a little orientation about the task you're interested in via [github issues](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/good%20first%20issue), [the development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/) and [tutorials](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html).

## Less is more

So, just plain `git grep` is great. On each line, you see the file path and the pattern match that was found. Here's the results I got when I was looking for the function `do_update_message` recently:

However, I only wanted a list of the files with matches to this function name, and the repetition of the match in `tests_event.py` and `tests_message_edit.py` made it harder for me to quickly get that information. 

Luckily, a quick read-through of the docs for `git grep` gave me a way to return a simplified view by using `git grep -c`.

This time, I've got a list of 7 files to look at and each line includes a count of how many times my pattern of `do_update_message` matched. If you don't want the count, then use `git grep -l` for the same list.

## Limit yourself to what you need

That's probably enough to get folks started, but here are a few more useful tips that could be useful as you get more and more familiar with your project's codebase.

After working on the project for a little while, I now know that the frontend implementation of Zulip's application features are in the `/static/js` directory and that the help center documentation files are in the `templates/zerver/help` directory. 

So, if I want even more targeted searches with `git grep`, I can include the pathspec in my searches to see only the files in those directories.

## A little bit of formatting goes a long way

Most of the time, we want to read through the code in our preferred IDE or source-code editor. But we can format our search results to get a little glimpse of the code with `git grep` in the terminal if we want.

Here are some of the `git grep` options we'll want to use:
- `--break` will print an empty line between matches from different files.
- `--heading` will show the file name on the line above the matches instead of the start of the line.
- `-n` will prefix the line number to the matching lines in the file.

And using them all together gives you a more readable output to the terminal.

## Summing up

This post only scratches the surface of using `git grep` and doesn't go into why it's faster / better than other command line tools like `grep` or `ack`. But hopefully it's enough to get some people started using it and curious to learn more. 

Definitely check out the official [`git grep` docs here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep).
