## Welcome to my Outreachy blog repository

I'm Lauryn, a self-taught programmer and previous arts administrator / ESL teacher.

This is my blog about what I'm working on with [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip) as an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) participant in the winter session of 2021/2022.

Here's a link to [the actual blog site](https://laurynmm.github.io/)
